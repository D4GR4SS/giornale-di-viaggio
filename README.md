# Travel Journal

Travel Journal is a React application built with Vite that allows users to explore various travel destinations. It renders information from the `TravelData` file into visually appealing cards, providing details about different locations, including title, location, Google Maps URL, dates, descriptions, and images.
Inspired by the solitary scrimba project. Totally created by me as I am not a pro member. üòÑ
This was a great refresher on using props between components and rendering multiple elements with .map()
